# NotEnoughUpdates Fork by DoKM

### Currently if you get a array out of bounds exception this is due to the todolist update
Please go into .minecraft/config/notenoughupdates and then open the configNew.json in a text editor.
In that file go to the "miscOverlays" section and find "todoText" and clear it.

This is a fork that I will try to keep updated with the original NEU repo while also adding features/fixing bugs etc.

**Currently the added features are:**

1. More options for the Todo list
2. Added the voidgloom slayer stats to the /pv
3. Added Dungeon accesories to the accesory bag upgrade view
4. Added Dungeon items to the itemlist categories (for example armors now include dungeon armors and weapons include dungeon weapons)
5. Added check to see if titanium that spawned atleast touches 1 air block (toggleable)
6. Added check so titanium alert doesnt happen if titanium commision is set to "DONE"
7. Added Storage to PV (with correct sizes)
8. Added Personal Vault to PV

**Currently the fixed features are:**

1. Todo list
	1. Fixed fetchur display
	2. Fixed godpot timer
	
2. PV's wardrobe view not showing second page bottom row (not fully fixed could be better by dividing on every 4 and drawing per column instead of row but right now its always a full page)
3. Made dwarven overlay work in crystal hollows
4. Added Gemstone powder to dwarven overlay
5. Made smooth aote work with aotv (thanks to 8k for letting me test his aotv)

**Currently the fixed bugs are:**

1. Arrow Key backpack option under storage gui not doing anything
2. Fixed pets gui going away if you open /pets
